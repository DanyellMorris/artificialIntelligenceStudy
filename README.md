# artificialIntelligenceStudy
A personal project studying current artificial intelligence (AI) models, their capabilities, and any data related to them.
--------------------------------------
AI has become a major topic in computer science and engineering spaces since 2022, though there are not many sources of information on current models avaliable.
This project seeks to become a source of information on current AI developments, as much of our current knowledge on these models/methods is not well documented [likely due to the incredible speed at which this technology has been developed].
